# Murmuration
A bird themed, open source, democratic decision making engine.

## What is a...that?

A "Democratic Decision Making Engine" is a fancy way of saying a voting
application. This gem seeks to be a flexible library for implementing different
voting systems, from ordinal systems like Borda, Condorcet, Ranked; to cardinal
systems such as STAR, approval, 3-2-1. The author's intention is to allow for
many different organizational structures to tailor decision making for their
particular definition of "fair". While this could be used to create systems that
few would recognize as "democratic", a foundational principle of this effort is
that the members of any organization should be able to define what they believe
to be "fair".

Given these values it is only natural that the software be open-source, to allow
for organizations and their members to understand how the system works, and be
able to tailor it to their specific needs if necessary. Furthermore, as it is
necessary to be understandable to the widest possible audience, it is imparitive
that the software be very well documented.

## Why is it "bird themed" then?

The initial use-case for this library is to allow birders to identify birds by
various kinds of observation (images, video, audio, textual description, etc.).
Furthermore, a "Murmuration" is the collective noun both for a flock of
Starlings and of the amazing collective decision making evidenced by a flock in
flight (of which Starlings are probably the most dramatic example). Also the
author just really likes birds, so deal with it.
